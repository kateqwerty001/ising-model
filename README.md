# IsingModel

This project implements the **Ising model** with:

- **3 interaction types**:
  - Ferromagnetic  
  - Antiferromagnetic  
  - Random

- **5 graph types**:
  - `LatticeGraph` (2D grid)  
  - `CompleteGraph`  
  - `ErdosRenyiGraph`  
  - `WattsStrogatzGraph`  
  - `BarabasiAlbertGraph`

The **Gibbs sampling** method was used for simulation.

Experiments were conducted to study how interaction types and graph topology affect system behavior.
